# Process

## Using Mapbox

Play with Mapbox studio.  Components are neat things like labels, but layers are where the action is.  Make a layer active, bind it to a dataset, bind the attributes of the dataset to various visible features like fill and extrude, then go to town.

## Getting data

[Get the shapefile for house districts.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2018-nation-u-s-116th-congressional-district-national)

Use `geopandas` to read the shapefile.  Observe that GEOID is the concat of state and district ID.  Split-apply-combine the date from house district votes into something unique on GEOID, merge the two together.  Write the shapefile.

## Put it in Mapbox!

Zip the shapefile contents, upload it as a tileset, use that tileset in your map.  EZ PZ.

## TODOs

Embed the hosted map somewhere, like [this](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/animate-camera-around-point/) or [this](https://maps4html.org/HTML-Map-Element-UseCases-Requirements/examples/add-custom-control.html).

Use precinct-level data from [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl%3A1902.1%2F21919&version=&q=&fileTypeGroupFacet=&fileAccess=&fileSortField=date)!  Has county codes!
