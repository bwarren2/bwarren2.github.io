summary: "Resources I found useful in learning Golang."

I was recently clued into Go being:

1. a really useful language to learn
2. theoretically easy to

Not missing a chance to learn, I have been diving in. This post is a history of my travels, so other travelers might benefit.

I don't know what your ideal way of learning a new programming language is, but for me it's a mix of working on problems, seeing good patterns, and hearing some of the underlying theory for why the language is the way it is. To that end, I have been using:

# Book + Offical Stuff

- [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/) - A book, 79% 5-star and 14% 4-star on Amazon as of writing. If stuck, see [solutions](https://github.com/torbiak/gopl).
- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) - "How to write clear, idiomatic code"
- [Go Spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec)
- [How To Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)
- [Go Blog](https://blog.golang.org/)

# Exercises

- [Exercism](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/go) - A reliable source of problems and answers for many languages, including Go.

# Walkthroughs/Tours

- [A Tour Of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) - The official tour of Go. A walkthrough of the features with a few problems thrown in. If you need them, see the [solutions](https://github.com/golang/tour).

# Juxtapositions

- [Go Vs Python](http://govspy.peterbe.com/) - How to do Python things in Go. Super useful for someone like me with questions like "But can I slice?"

# Concurrency Patterns
