I am not the first person to do this kind of learning process; I just happen to be logging the first time doing it myself.  For others walking this road, here are resources I have found useful:

### [Grokking the Systems Design Intervew](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)

This is an excellent resources for concepts and walkthroughs of a few example problems, but it doesn't teach you to navigate the awkward hidden expectations game of the interview.  (As mentioned in [Parkmobile 2]({{< ref "parkmobile_2.md" >}}), interviewers give you a super broad mission statement like "design Parkmobile", but _actually_ prefer you spend time on the parts they think are interesting enough to discuss.)  I read through this resource before my interview, but it did not do the trick for me.

### [TianPan](https://tianpan.co/notes/2016-02-13-crack-the-system-design-interview/)


I have only skimmed some of the articles, but it feels like a good mix of case studies and theory.  Some of the pieces are a little thin, but it is a big chunk of material.  At least useful for getting potential problems, working them yourself, and comparing notes with their answers.
